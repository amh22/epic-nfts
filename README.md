# Full-stack Ethereum App for an NFT Collection (Rinkeby testnet)

The app allows users to mint 1 of 50 available NFTs. The MetaMask browser extension is used for connecting a user's wallet and signing the transaction. On mint, the contract dynamically creates and stores base64 encoded SVGs permanently on-chain. 

View the collection on OpenSea: https://testnets.opensea.io/collection/minftys

The contract: https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/address/0x2cd192f3620b278f767b6f17bb8c48558a2126e3
